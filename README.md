# SelfDrivinCarTobi

This is a small Unity Project. The Unity project is based on this project, I rebuilded there code and tried to understand it
https://github.com/MCKapur/SPCSAISelfDrivingCar.
This Part was for learning some basic Unity Concepts and refreshing these concepts.
The second part of the Project was a Python Rest Server which should give the car commands if it drives in the 'autonomous mode'.
The Machine Learning Model  I tried first was a Naive Bayes Classifier, which classified if the car should Turn Left, TurnRight, ShouldAccelerate.

<h3> This was just the basic framework. When I wil have time again I want to try different machine learning algorithms in order to predict the commands that are useful for the autonomous driving. </h3>
